\arguments{
\item{pool}{pool connection to IDBac database}

\item{h}{numeric scalar (OR a vector) with a height where the tree
should be cut.}

\item{k}{numeric scalar (OR a vector) with the number of clusters
the tree should be cut into.}

\item{minFrequency}{percent of peaks that must be present in sample replicates (0 to 1)}

\item{minNumber}{
    \code{double}, remove all peaks which occur in less than
    \code{minNumber} \code{\linkS4class{MassPeaks}}
    objects. It is an absolute threshold.
  }

\item{small_mol_lowerMassCutoff}{lower mass cutoff for small molecule spectra}

\item{small_mol_upperMassCutoff}{upper mass cutoff for small molecule spectra}

\item{small_mol_SNR}{minimum SNR for small molecule spectra}

\item{tolerance}{
    \code{double}, maximal relative deviation of a peak position (mass) to be
    considered as identical. Must be multiplied by \code{10^-6} for ppm,
    e.g. use \code{tolerance=5e-6} for 5 ppm.
  }

\item{percent_metabolite_peaks_to_retain}{percent of small molecule peaks to "capture" when selecting isolates}
